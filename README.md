# Wetter•Freund
The Wetter•Freund is a DIY Weather station with ESP and Arduino. Don't spend €150 (or more) on Amazon – just build your own smart weather station with WebUI and a couple of cool functions for just a few bucks. You just need some electronic parts you can easily buy on AliExpress (5€-all together) and a housing which is about €15. Use my code as is or adopt it on your needs or language. But most important: have fun!

### Hardware:
- ESP-02s (8285) - any ESP8266 should work at least!
- BME280 Sensor
- Buck-Converter 5V/3,3V
- LED flashlight (to avoid plane crashes ... ;-))
- Switch to start AP

### Functions of the Software:
- Data Preview
- Calculated date (Barometer, dewpoint, weather warnings)
- Location
- MQTT
- Logs (different)
- Telemetry data
- OTA(!)
- JSON
- RESET

### What we don't offer:
- NO useless or unusable spy app
- NO Cloud at the end of the world collecting your data. YOUR data stays in YOUR home!
- NO eye-burning dashboard - the software ist for admin use, but it still looks kind of nice.
